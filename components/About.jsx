          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
            I specialize in building mobile responsive front-end UI applications
            that connect with APIâ€™s and other backend technologies. Iâ€™m
            passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is
            more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient
            in building front-end applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and
            React, I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as
            needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one
            specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job.
          </p>
          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
            But before I become a Web Developer, I work in a construction firm for almost 5 years, I had gained my skills for project management, detailed oriented skilled, and communication skilled development. But I am currently working as a full stack developer. I do freelance work, and I am always looking for new opportunities.
