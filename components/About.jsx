          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
            I specialize in building mobile responsive Front-end UI applications
            that connect with APIâ€™s and other backend technologies. Iâ€™m
            passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is
            more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient
            in building front-end applications using <span className='font-semibold text-[#006964]'>HTML, CSS, Javascript</span>, and <span className='font-semibold text-[#006964]'>React</span>, I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as
            needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one
            specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job.
          </p>
